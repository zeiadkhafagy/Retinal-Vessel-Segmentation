## **Overview**
This project focuses on segmenting **retinal blood vessels** from fundus images, a critical task in diagnosing and managing conditions like **diabetic retinopathy** and **glaucoma**.

---

## **Features**
- Implements **state-of-the-art segmentation models**.
- Supports **custom dataset training**.
- **Pretrained model weights** available for quick inference.

---

## **Dataset**
The project uses the **[DRIVE dataset](https://drive.grand-challenge.org/)** for training and evaluation. Additional datasets like **[CHASE_DB1](https://blogs.kingston.ac.uk/retinal/chasedb1/)** and **[STARE](http://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/stare/probing/index.html)** can also be integrated.
